# Candy Crush Game

To practice React Front end framework working I went a head and created a **[Browser version of the Candy Crush Game](https://dionnenoellabarretto.github.io/CandyCrushGame/)** [inspired](https://reactjsexample.com/a-minimal-game-of-candy-crush-in-react/) game that allows users to score every time they match a kind of candy horizontally or vertically by dragging and dropping candy's vertically or horizontally to form a row/ column or 3's/4's or 5's of a kind!
