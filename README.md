# CandyCrushGame


To practice React Front end framework working I went a head and created a Candy Crush inspired game that allows users to score every time they match a kind of candy horizontally or vertically by dragging and dropping candy's vertically or horizontally to form a row/ column or 3's/4's or 5's of a kind!
